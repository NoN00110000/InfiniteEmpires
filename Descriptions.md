"Infinite Empires" is a sci-fi themed incremental game set in a galaxy far, far away where players must build and manage their own space empire. Starting with a single planet and a small fleet of ships, players must explore the galaxy and discover new planets to colonize and expand their empires. As they explore, they may encounter other empires, both friendly and hostile, with whom they can trade, form alliances, or go to war.

The game features a prestige system, which allows players to track their progress and success within the game. As they earn prestige points, they can unlock new technologies, abilities, and resources that help them to grow and expand their empire. The prestige system is tiered, with different levels of prestige awarded for larger and more advanced empires.

Some of the possible levels of prestige in the game include: Explorer, Settler, City-builder, Country-builder, World-builder, Solar system-builder, Galaxy-builder, Universe-builder, and Multiverse-builder. Each of these levels corresponds to a different stage in the growth and development of the player's empire, and unlocks new technologies, abilities, and resources as they progress through the game.
