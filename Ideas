I want to create a text-based game with buttons and other user interface elements.
I want to use JavaScript to implement the game's logic and mechanics, as well as its user interface and interactivity.
I want to use libraries and frameworks such as jQuery, Vue.js, and TypeScript to help me develop the game.
I plan to use npm to install these libraries and frameworks.
I plan to use a text editor or code editor to write and manage my code.
